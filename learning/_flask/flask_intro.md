# Flask: A Web Application Framework for Python

Flask is a lightweight and versatile web application framework for Python, designed to make getting started with web development quick and easy. It is developed by Armin Ronacher and maintained by an international group of Python enthusiasts known as Pocco. Flask is built on top of the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and Jinja2 template engine, both of which are also Pocco projects.

## Key Features

- **Lightweight**: Flask is minimalist in design and doesn't impose any dependencies or project structure.
- **Easy to Get Started**: Flask provides a simple and intuitive API, making it ideal for beginners.
- **Extensible**: Flask allows developers to add functionality through extensions, which are readily available for tasks like authentication, database integration, and more.
- **WSGI Compatibility**: Flask is compliant with the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI), allowing it to run on a variety of web servers and platforms.

## Installation

There are two common ways to install Flask:

1. **Using a Requirements File**: You can install Flask and its dependencies listed in a `requirements.txt` file using the command:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2. **Direct Installation**: Alternatively, you can install Flask directly via pip with the command:
    ```
    pip install flask
    ```

## Getting Started

To create a basic Flask application, you typically follow these steps:

1. **Install Flask**: Use one of the installation methods mentioned above to install Flask.
2. **Create a Python File**: Write a Python script to define your Flask application.
3. **Define Routes**: Define routes using decorators to specify which functions should handle which URLs.
4. **Create Templates**: Create HTML templates using Jinja2 to render dynamic content.
5. **Run the Application**: Run your Flask application using the `flask run` command.

## Example Application

Here's a simple example of a Flask application:

```python
from flask import Flask, render_template

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def index():
 return render_template('index.html', title='Home')

if __name__ == '__main__':
 app.run(debug=True)
```
